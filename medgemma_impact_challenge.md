Description
AI is already reshaping medicine, from diagnostics to drug discovery. But many clinical environments can’t rely on large, closed models that require constant internet access or centralized infrastructure. They need adaptable, privacy-focused tools that can run anywhere care is delivered.

To meet this need, Google has released open-weight models specifically designed to help developers more efficiently create novel healthcare and life sciences applications. MedGemma and the rest of HAI-DEF collection give developers a starting point for building powerful tools while allowing them full control over the models and associated infrastructure.

In this competition, you’ll use these models to build full fledged demonstration applications. Whether you’re building apps to streamline workflows, support patient communication, or facilitate diagnostics, your solution should demonstrate how these tools can enhance healthcare.

Evaluation
Minimum requirements
To be considered a valid contribution, your submission should include:

a high-quality writeup describing use of a specific HAI-DEF model,
associated reproducible code for your initial results, and
a video for judging.
Your complete submission consists of a single package containing your video (3 minutes or less) and write-up (3 pages or less). This single entry can be submitted to the main competition track, and one special technology award, so separate submissions are not required. Read the section Submission Instructions for more details. Please follow the provided write-up template and refer to the judging criteria for all content requirements.

Evaluation Criteria
Submissions are evaluated on the following criteria:

Criteria (percentage)	Description
Effective use of HAI-DEF models
(20%)	Are HAI-DEF models used appropriately?

You will be assessed on: whether the submission proposes an application that uses HAI-DEF models to their fullest potential, where other solutions would likely be less effective.

Note: Use of at least one of HAI-DEF models such as MedGemma is mandatory.
Problem domain
(15%)	How important is this problem to solve and how plausible is it that AI is the right solution?

You will be assessed on: storytelling, clarity of problem definition, clarity on whether there is an unmet need, the magnitude of the problem, who the user is and their improved journey given your solution.
Impact potential
(15%)	If the solution works, what impact would it have?

You will be assessed on: clear articulation of real or anticipated impact of your application within the given problem domain and description of how you calculated your estimates.
Product feasibility
(20%)	Is the technical solution clearly feasible?

You will be assessed on: technical documentation detailing model fine-tuning, model's performance analysis, your user-facing application stack, deployment challenges and how you plan on overcoming them. Consideration of how a product might be used in practice, rather than only for benchmarking.
Execution and communication (30%)	What is the quality of your project's execution and your clear and concise communication of your work? Your main submission package follows the provided template and includes a mandatory video demo and a write-up with links to your source material.

You will be assessed on: the clarity, polish, and effectiveness of your video demonstration; the completeness and readability of your technical write-up; and the quality of your source code (e.g., organization, comments, reusability). Judges will look for a cohesive and compelling narrative across all submitted materials that effectively articulates how you meet the rest of the judging criteria.
Timeline
January 13, 2026 - Start Date.
February 24, 2026 - Final Submission Deadline.
March 17 - 24, 2026 - Anticipated Results Announcement - Time required to evaluate results is dependent on the number of submissions.
All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.

Submission Instructions
Your submission must be a Kaggle Writeup and it must be attached to this page. To create a new Writeup, click on the "New Writeup" button here. After you have saved your Writeup, you should see a "Submit" button in the top right corner. Each team is limited to submitting only a single Writeup, but that same Writeup can be un-submitted, edited, and re-submitted as many times as you'd like. Your Writeup should contain a summary of your overall project along with links to supporting resources.

Choosing a track
All submissions compete in the Main Track, and are eligible to win one special award prize (Agentic Workflow Prize, The Novel Task Prize, or The Edge of AI Prize). While you will have the option to select multiple tracks when you create your writeup, you can only chose the main track and one special award prize. If you choose multiple special awards, we will only consider your submission for one of your indicated special awards (randomly selected).

Links
Required: Video (3 min or less)
Required: Public code repository
Bonus: Public interactive live demo app
Bonus: Open-weight Hugging Face model tracing to a HAI-DEF model

"Robust medical Machine Learning (ML) models have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by accelerating clinical research, improving workflows and outcomes, and producing novel insights or capabilities. Developing such ML models from scratch is cost prohibitive and requires substantial compute, data, and time (e.g., expert labeling). To address these challenges, the authors introduced Health AI Developer Foundations (HAI-DEF), a suite of pre-trained, domain-specific foundation models, tools, and recipes to accelerate building ML for health applications."

"The models cover various modalities and domains, including radiology (X-rays and computed tomography), histopathology, dermatological imaging, and audio. These models provide domain specific embeddings that facilitate AI development with less labeled data, shorter training times, and reduced computational costs compared to traditional approaches."

MODELS
CXR Foundation

"CXR Foundation is a set of 3 models, all using an EfficientNet-L2 image encoder backbone. The three models learned representations of CXRs by leveraging both the image data and the clinically relevant information available in corresponding radiology reports."

Path Foundation

"Path Foundation is a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for histopathology image patches trained with self-supervised learning."

Derm Foundation

"Derm Foundation is a BiT ResNet-101x3 image encoder trained using a two-stage approach on over 16K natural and dermatology images."

HeAR

"HeAR is a ViT audio encoder trained using a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) approach. The model learns to reconstruct masked spectrogram patches, capturing rich acoustic representations of health-related sounds like coughs and breathing patterns."

CT Foundation

"CT Foundation provides embeddings suitable for downstream classification tasks. The underlying model is VideoCoCa, a video-text model designed for efficient transfer learning from 2D Contrastive Captioners (CoCa)."

Limitations

"The models were developed with a focus on classification tasks, and prognosis tasks will need to be further evaluated. Image segmentation and generation tasks are also currently not supported. Further,specific requirements such as smaller models (e.g. for on-device applications on a mobile device) or lower latency will need other techniques such as distillation to the target model size of interest."

AI in healthcare writeup
Here is a link to the write-up I created for the Meta Kaggle Hackathon on AI use cases in healthcare. Might help in generating ideas on what use cases to tackle for this hackathon.
