## Script

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)

**[SCENE: Rural village setting, CHW with patients]**

**NARRATION:**
> "In rural Uganda, Maria is a community health worker serving 500 families. She has 6 weeks of training, no internet, and no specialist to call. Today, she'll see 20 patients with conditions ranging from skin rashes to respiratory infections.
>
> Until now, she relied on memory and paper guidelines. But what if she had a specialist in her pocket?"

**[TRANSITION: MedAssist CHW logo appears]**

> "Introducing MedAssist CHW - an AI companion that brings specialist-level diagnostics to the frontlines of global health."
